Certainly! Here are some possible questions along with their answers for a college lab viva on the topic of DBMS using SQL:

### Concept &amp; Overview of Database Management Systems (DBMS):
**1. Q: What are the characteristics of a Database Management System (DBMS)?**


- A: Characteristics of DBMS include data independence, concurrent access, data integrity, and security.

**2. Q: Explain the Three Schema architecture.**


- A: The Three Schema architecture includes the user schema (also called subschema), logical schema, and physical schema, providing a clear separation between user applications and the physical storage of data.

**3. Q: Differentiate between structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.**


- A: Structured data is organized in a tabular format, semi-structured data has a flexible schema, and unstructured data lacks a predefined data model.

### ER Model:
**4. Q: What are the basic concepts of the Entity-Relationship (ER) model?**


- A: Basic concepts include entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints.

**5. Q: Explain weak entities and relationships of degree 3 in the ER model.**


- A: Weak entities depend on another entity for identification, and relationships of degree 3 involve three entities connected by a relationship.

### Structure of Relational Databases:
**6. Q: How do you synthesize an ER diagram into a relational schema?**


- A: This involves identifying entities, relationships, and attributes, and then mapping them to tables, fields, and relationships in a relational database.

**7. Q: What are integrity constraints in the context of relational databases?**


- A: Integrity constraints ensure the accuracy and consistency of data, including primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, etc.

### Relational Algebra and SQL:
**8. Q: Explain the basic operations in Relational Algebra - select, project, and cartesian product.**

**9. Q: Provide examples of SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) commands.**


- A: Examples include CREATE, DROP, ALTER for defining tables and their structures.

**10. Q: How do you write SQL queries involving multiple tables?**

### SQL DML (Data Manipulation Language):
**11. Q: What is a nested query in SQL, and what is the difference between correlated and non-correlated nested queries?**

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Here are more questions related to the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model section:

### ER Model:
**26. Q: Define the term "entity" in the context of the ER model.**
- A: An entity represents a real-world object or concept, such as a person, place, or thing, about which data can be stored.

**27. Q: Explain the difference between an entity set and an entity.**
- A: An entity is a single occurrence of a real-world object, while an entity set is a collection of similar entities.

**28. Q: What are attributes in the ER model, and how are they represented?**
- A: Attributes are properties or characteristics of an entity. They are represented as ovals in the ER diagram.

**29. Q: Discuss the concept of relationships in the ER model.**
- A: Relationships represent associations between entities. They are depicted as diamond shapes in the ER diagram.

**30. Q: Explain the terms "cardinality" and "participation" in the context of relationships.**
- A: Cardinality defines the number of instances of one entity that can be related to another, while participation indicates whether the existence of an entity in a relationship is mandatory or optional.

**31. Q: Describe the different types of relationships in the ER model.**
- A: Relationships can be classified as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many, based on the cardinality.

**32. Q: What is a weak entity in the ER model, and how is it different from a strong entity?**
- A: A weak entity is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone and depends on another entity (owner entity). In contrast, a strong entity can be uniquely identified by its own attributes.

**33. Q: How is a ternary relationship different from binary relationships in the ER model?**
- A: A ternary relationship involves three entities, while binary relationships involve only two. Ternary relationships are depicted using a diamond with three connecting lines.

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Here are more questions related to the Database Design and Normalization section:

### Database Design and Normalization:
**56. Q: Explain the concept of functional dependency in the context of database design.**
- A: Functional dependency is a relationship between two sets of attributes in a database. If knowing the value of one set uniquely determines the value of another, there is a functional dependency.

**57. Q: What are Armstrong's Axioms, and how are they relevant to functional dependencies?**
- A: Armstrong's Axioms are a set of inference rules used for reasoning about functional dependencies. They include the Reflexivity, Augmentation, and Transitivity rules.

**59. Q: What is a minimal cover in the context of functional dependencies?**
- A: A minimal cover is the smallest set of functional dependencies equivalent to the given set, satisfying the same closure.

**60. Q: Explain the concept of normalization and its goals in the context of database design.**
- A: Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and dependency. Its goals include minimizing data anomalies, improving data integrity, and optimizing data storage.

**61. Q: Define First Normal Form (1NF) and provide an example.**
- A: 1NF requires that each attribute value in a table is atomic. Example: A table with a multivalued attribute is not in 1NF.

**62. Q: Discuss the concept of transitive dependency in the context of normalization.**

**63. Q: Explain the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) and how it differs from Third Normal Form (3NF).**
- A: BCNF is a stricter form of normalization compared to 3NF. It requires that every non-trivial functional dependency in the table is a dependency on a superkey.

**64. Q: What is the significance of lossless join and dependency-preserving decomposition in normalization?**
- A: Lossless join ensures that decomposing tables can be rejoined without losing information, and dependency-preserving decomposition ensures that functional dependencies are preserved during decomposition.
